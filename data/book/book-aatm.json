				"The Mortuary rises above Sigil, the crossroads of the multiverse, like a dead hand erupting from a grave. Headquarters of the Heralds of Dust, one of the oldest philosophical factions in the City of Doors, the Mortuary is a house of death: a morgue, funeral home, and tomb of immense scale linked to burial sites on other planes and worlds. The Mortuary is located in the Hive Ward, the seediest of Sigil's districts. In the Mortuary's eerie yet reverent chambers, the Heralds of Dust receive, process, and lay the dead to rest on a multiversal scale, ensuring every creature that dies in Sigil earns its obsequies.",
